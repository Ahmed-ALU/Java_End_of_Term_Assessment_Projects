1- Can a class inherit multiple classes in java? justify your answer.?

    The answer here is complex, but it is probably no. Java doesn't support multible classes inheritance,
    but it supports multible implementation using interfaces; that's because a class can inherit only one
    class and multiple interfaces in a java programs.
    for example:
    class A{}
    class B{}
    class C extends A,B{} --> This is wrong.

    The right way is as the following:
    class A{}
    interface B{}
    interface C{}

    class D extends A implements B, C{ --> This is right.
    This last one is correct as this example is extending only one class A and implementing multiple interfaces i.e. B and C.

    This takes us to question number two:
    2- Can a class implement multiple interfaces? justify your answer?

    The answer here has been given above, which is yes, a class can implement multible interfaces.
    which is the only way to multibally inherit and avoid the problems that comes with multible classes
    inheritance.

    The reason that Java class cannot extend multiple classes is a problem called "the diamond problem"
    "The Diamond problem" occurs due of constructor chaining.
    On the other hand, constructor is not present in Interface so no the diamond problem won't occur
    if we implement multiple interfaces.
