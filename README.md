# Java_End_of_Term_Assessment_Projects
This repository contains the codes of the End of Term Assessment projects for the course "Database Systems" in my year two at The African Leadership University in Rwanda.


### The prompt is as the following:

**Instructions**
  The work will be done individually.
  The code shall be submitted in a zipped file.
  The source codes will be shared in .java files.
  The work will be graded out of 25 points.
  The work will be done in a maximum of 2 weeks.
  The submission will be done on canvas only.


**Learning Outcomes**
  Combining variables, classes, objects, control flow and repetitive structures.
  Creating database and interact with it using java interfaces.
  Adding events and event listeners to the interface objects.
  Implementing inheritance and interfaces
  Achieving modularization
 
-----------------------------------------------------

**Qn1. Calculator** 

In this assessment, you will be building a simple calculator which can be used for simple arithmetic operations. The calculator shall be having a keypad with all numbers from 0 to 9, all arithmetic operators, the equal sign and C button to clear the screen (of the calculator).

The user will type the first number, type the operator, type the second number and type the equal sign to the computed value.

You are required to package your source code and make it executable in a sense that even it is copied to the computer without java environment setup, they can run it and see the expected results

You will also implement unit testing for every operation; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to check their correctness.


----------------------------------------------

**Qn2. Registration Process**

ALU wants to host an application that will help students to apply and get classified to the program that is most appropriate to them considering their marks. Students will open the application and will be asked to sign in if they already have accounts or create accounts (sign up) if they don’t have. After a successful login, a student registers using their names and grades. The system shall generate a roll number to that student. The registration number shall be the current year and the unique number of the student (2022/01, 2022/02, etc). Based on the grade the application will put a student to their appropriate programme. 

If the student’s mark is between 18 and 20 out of 20, the student will be put under computer Science

If the student’s mark is between 15 and 17 out of 20, the student will be put under global challenges.

If the student’s mark is between 12 and 14 out of 20, the student will be put under business studies. 

Otherwise, the student will not be considered for admission at ALU.

The student will register for admission and go to the admission slot tab to check the admission state and all details related to him/her in the system.

**Qn3. Inheritance and Interfaces**

Choose two scenarios whereby in the first scenario, you implement inheritance while in the second scenario, you will implement an interface. As you have your two scenarios implemented, make sure the right access modifiers, attributes, and methods are properly implemented.

Can a class inherit multiple classes in java? justify your answer.
Can a class implement multiple interfaces? justify your answer.
